//: # UIStackView Challenge
//: The challenge is to have a function that takes a stack view and an array of views, and that through the (1) nesting of additional stack views, (2) alteration of the main stack view's axis, and (3) scaling of images, is able without distortion to make the best use of the available space (i.e. display images at their largest possible size).
