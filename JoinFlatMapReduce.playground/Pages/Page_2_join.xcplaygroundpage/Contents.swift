//: # join()
//: join() begins with a joining element that is the same type as the sequence being joined. This is best explained with an array of strings
", ".join(["one","two","three"])  // "one, two, three"
//: notice that with join() the joining element is inserted after each item in the array but not at the beginning or end. This is the limit of join. It has a joining element and it has the items to be joined. Whether this be an array of arrays or an array of strings. It is to be noted, however, that it is not a way of combining numbers and is reserved for arrays (and collections) of sequences, strings and character views.
