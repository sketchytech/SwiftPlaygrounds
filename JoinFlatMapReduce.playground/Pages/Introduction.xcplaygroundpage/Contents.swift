//: # Introduction
//: This is the first ever piece that I've written first as a playground and second as a [blogpost](http://sketchytech.blogspot.com/2015/06/similarly-different-join-reduce-and.html). This is something that I'd like to make the norm wherever possible and will endeavour to do so. It covers a selection of higher order functions in Swift and draws attention to their similarities and differences. Enjoy!
